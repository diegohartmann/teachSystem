# A web system with slides and anotations

## Save anotation feature
The 'copy' button under the anotation textarea does not only saves the anotation to the user's clipboard
but also saves it in the browser's localStorage, so if the page is refreshed or reopened, it is still there.

## System is still in develop
Feel free to send any idea or feedback :)
